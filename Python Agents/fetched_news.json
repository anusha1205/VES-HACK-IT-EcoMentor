Lady Gaga performed as part of this pre-taped segment, singing “Hold My Hand,” her song from “Top Gun: Maverick.”And, Brad Pitt introduced the Super Bowl on Fox with a video championing the resilience of Americans and the unifying aspect of the NFL championship. — Sarah WhittenFollow and listen to the CNBC Sport podcastCNBC Sport is now a podcast.

The growing adoption of GLP-1 drugs has only increased this demand because patients need to eat enough protein to prevent muscle loss.— Amelia LucasWhy the BetMGM CEO is rooting for the EaglesBetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt really wants the Eagles to win Sunday’s Super Bowl, because it’s best for the sportsbook. Greenblatt spoke to CNBC about improvements in the digital product and how they’ve fueled momentum to start 2025. He said more parlay offers on an app that operates faster is drawing in higher margin players. And while Greenblatt is optimistic about BetMGM’s potential for growth in sports betting, he said the online casino business, or iGaming, is on fire, with a 55% year-over-year increase in active players, without adding any additional markets or states.— Contessa BrewerAsk the Athletes: Sports bettingAsk the Athletes: Best investing adviceFanatics says its sportsbook is ready for game dayFanatics Sportsbook is looking to show off the innovative ways it rewards its players and the advantage it gives them over their competitors. Fanatics Betting and Gaming CEO Matt King sat down with CNBC to talk about the company’s loyalty program powered by FanCash, which customers can then use to buy sports merchandise from Fanatics. The company says at least 3 in 4 Fanatics Sportsbook customers are using FanCash each month for purchases. It’s also introduced a type of parlay insurance as part of the Fair Play program for instances when an athlete is injured early in a game. King said the sportsbook has refunded about $3.5 million under the program so far.— Contessa BrewerDraftKings CEO Jason Robins on bet offerings and the threat of taxesDraftKings co-founder and CEO Jason Robins spoke to CNBC fresh off an NFL regular season that cost U.S. sportsbooks big time as fan favorites kept winning. Robins said “diverse bet offerings will make game outcomes less impactful.” For instance, he said more money is coming in on player props. DraftKings and other sportsbooks face the prospect of much higher state taxes in Ohio and Maryland, even as competition increases from sweepstakes-style gaming, fantasy plus, prediction markets and offshore. “You are talking orders of magnitude larger than is going to be wagered in the legal market this year,” he said. — Contessa BrewerAd executives say Super Bowl commercials are still worth itJonathan Bachman | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesNEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA – FEBRUARY 03: A detailed view of drink koozies seen during an event ahead of Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 03, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana. (Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)The cost of Super Bowl commercials steps up ever year — this year some went for a record $8 million — and yet ad industry executives say the cost is still worth it.The reason? No other TV event beckons such a large audience in one sitting. Last year more than 123 million people tuned into the Super Bowl. This year it’ll be broadcast on Fox, as well as aired on its free streamer, Tubi, which could mean more viewers, too.“The scale and buzz factor still delivers a punch,” said Amy Leifer, DirecTV’s chief advertising sales officer.For brands there are some factors that play into whether spending big on the Super Bowl is worth it. One important factor is the ad’s placement during the game, getting as specific as what quarter the ad airs in. And thinking of the target audience rather than the size of the audience is important, too, said Andre Banks, CEO and founder of ad data firm NewWorld.Launching a new product is always a positive during the Super Bowl, said Kevin Krim, CEO of EDO, an ad data firm. When companies like Kia and Popeye’s launched new products in Super Bowl commercials in recent years, online engagement with the brands remained elevated in the weeks after the game, Krim said.— Lillian RizzoCosm is looking to take its immersive sports viewing internationalCosm, the immersive sports-viewing venue company, is looking to go international — and potentially to raise new funding.CEO Jeb Terry told CNBC Sport this week that Cosm is fielding inbound calls from real estate developers and municipality leaders in countries around the world.“I get calls daily from everywhere in Europe,” Terry said. “You look at calls from China, the Middle East, Japan. Australia is banging down our door. There’s an opportunity to bring these venues globally, and we’re looking to figure out what’s the best path to do that.”Watch the full interview above.— Alex ShermanContent creators swarm the big game on brand contractsKatie AustinCreator Katie Austin at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, LouisianaContent creators will play a pivotal role in the NFL’s strategy to attract Generation Z and Alpha audiences for this year’s Super Bowl.Hundreds of creators are swarming the Big Easy for Super Bowl 59, getting paid as much as six figures to make content for brands like Microsoft, Verizon, Electronic Arts and Nike.The initiative, in collaboration with platforms like YouTube and Snapchat, underscores the NFL’s shift toward marketing strategies that prioritize digitally native audiences.— Zach ValleseCaesars takes center stage in New OrleansIt’s a big weekend for Caesars Entertainment – the first casino partner of the NFL – with naming rights to the Caesars Superdome and a new $435 million renovation to unveil at its casino, sportsbook and hotel in New Orleans.CEO Tom Reeg told CNBC it’s a huge opportunity to introduce, or re-introduce, the brand to customers.“Maybe they’ve got a dated view of what Caesars used to be, even in New Orleans,” Reeg said. “They see this and go back and are impressed with it.”As of Sunday around 4 p.m. ET, the sportsbook had tallied seven bets for more than $100,000 each. The largest wager placed with Caesars, for $250,000, was placed on-site at Caesars New Orleans. — Contessa BrewerAsk the Athletes: TariffsFanDuel floods the zone on Super Bowl weekendFanDuel CEO Amy Howe spoke to CNBC about how she expects the company’s investment in the Super Bowl bonanza to pay off in customer acquisition opportunities. When asked about a bipartisanship request for the DOJ to investigate alleged anti-competitive practices by FanDuel and DraftKings, Howe said she’s confident that FanDuel is compliant with antitrust laws, “but there is still a half a trillion black market with offshore operators that aren’t paying any taxes.”— Contessa BrewerTrump congratulates both teams ahead of the gameKevin Lamarque | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump raises his fist as he steps from Air Force One upon arrival in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., Feb. 7,2025. In a message from the White House ahead of the Super Bowl, President Donald Trump congratulated the players, coaches and staff on the Eagles and Chiefs, saying that they “represent the best of the best in professional football, but they also embody the best of the American Dream.”“Their hard work, dedication, and tenacity is admirable, and their individual journeys are as inspiring as the drive and determination that has led them to this extraordinary moment,” he added.In the message, Trump also offered condolences to the families who lost loved ones in the terror attack in New Orleans on New Year’s Day.“While thousands of fans from across our Nation gather in New Orleans to cheer on their favorite team, we remember that 14 families will be missing a loved one who was tragically murdered during a senseless terrorist attack while celebrating the New Year on Bourbon Street,” the president wrote. “Our thoughts are also with the 35 individuals injured during the attack whose lives were changed forever that fateful night, and our prayers will remain with them for continued strength, comfort, and healing.”— Alexandra Marquez, NBC NewsEagles fans flock to New OrleansBuyers from Pennsylvania have purchased 15% of Super Bowl tickets sold on ticketing site StubHub, according to data from the company Sunday.

The average price of tickets sold at this point is just over $6,500, more than 20% lower than the average price last year. “This Super Bowl has sold more tickets than any Chiefs Super Bowl in StubHub history, thanks to more approachable prices compared to previous years.

Despite the bird flu outbreak, which has decimated egg-laying flocks, chickens raised for meat have been mostly unaffected.Inflation on an annual basis for fresh and frozen chicken parts is hovering just above 1% nationwide, according to the most recent consumer price index from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s about half the national average for the overall CPI.However, previous bouts of inflation mean that chicken prices are much higher than they were just four years ago. The price for chicken parts today is up almost 25% from 2021. By contrast, the general CPI is only 21% higher than it was four years ago.— Gabriel CortésKendrick Lamar headlines halftime showKevin Mazur | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesKendrick Lamar accepts the Song of the Year award for “Not Like Us” onstage during the 67th Annual Grammy Awards at Crypto.com Arena on Feb. 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.Rapper Kendrick Lamar is headlining this year’s halftime show fresh off a massive night at the Grammys.Lamar’s “Not Like Us” single swept all five categories it was nominated in last weekend, winning Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song and Best Music Video.The song made waves when it was first released in May as one of several diss tracks traded between Lamar and fellow rapper Drake. Drake last month sued his record label, Universal Music Group, claiming the label, which also represents Lamar, defamed him by distributing a “false and malicious narrative” with the song.Lamar is launching a national tour with R&B singer SZA in April. SZA is also set to perform during Sunday’s halftime show, sponsored by Apple Music. — Sara SalinasAsk the Athletes: AI Manning vs. Manning in the ‘Kick of Destiny’Rob Gronkowski had two chances at FanDuel’s “Kick of Destiny” — now it’s the Manning brothers’ turn.During the Super Bowl pregame show in New Orleans, Peyton and Eli Manning will each get a chance to kick a 25-yard field goal in what’s becoming the most high-profile annual pregame betting opportunity.According to FanDuel’s official rules, if both Mannings miss their field goal, the marker is moved up five yards. If they both make it, the ball remains at the same spot and they kick again.

Winners will receive an equal share of the $10 million prize pool.— Sarah WhittenSpanish-language telecasts will be on Fox Deportes and TelemundoViewers looking for a Spanish-language telecast of the Super Bowl will have two options this year: Fox’s cable TV network Fox Deportes and NBCUniversal’s over-the-air broadcaster Telemundo.The first time the Super Bowl aired in Spanish was in 2015 on Fox Deportes. Telemundo’s first broadcast of the Super Bowl took place in 2022, and the network has seen its viewership of NFL games significantly grow since then. Last fall, the two networks announced they would each air the Super Bowl and produce separate broadcasts.While NFL games, especially the Super Bowl, are known for their explosive ratings, the league has been pushing to expand its audience, both globally and within the U.S. A key part of that strategy is Hispanic viewership, CNBC reported last year.— Lillian RizzoFox nabs $8M ads for Super Bowl this yearDon Juan Moore | Getty ImagesA general view from outside of the Caesars Superdome prior to the Super Bowl LIX Opening Night fueled by Gatorade with Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 3, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana.Advertisers once again shelled out a record amount for spots during the Super Bowl this year. Broadcaster Fox sold out of ad spots in the fall for the Super Bowl, and more than 10 of its 30-second commercials were priced at $8 million, CNBC previously reported. Advertisers that got in early spent more than $7 million, the person said.Few live events or TV programming garner the audience that the Super Bowl does each year, ensuring advertisers are willing to pay up to have their brands in front of millions of eyeballs at once.Last year Nielsen reported roughly 123.7 million people watched the Super Bowl. This year has potential for even more viewers with Fox offering the game on its free streaming service Tubi.— Lillian RizzoFree streamer Tubi will air the Super Bowl for the first timePavlo Gonchar | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe Super Bowl is no stranger to streaming as broadcasters have been offering simulcasts of the game on their services in recent years. What’s different this year is that the Super Bowl will be available on Tubi, the Fox-owned free, ad-supported streaming service.Consumers without cable TV subscriptions or access to the game through traditional methods will be able to watch it for free on the Tubi app, which is available on streaming TVs, devices and phones. Fox Deportes’ Spanish-language telecast will be offered, too, and Tubi will have an exclusive pregame Red Carpet show for those looking for an alternative to the typical pregame show.Tubi’s viewership skews toward millennials, Gen Z and women, expanding potential fandom for the NFL and reach for advertisers that have shelled out big bucks. Tubi will air the same feeds as those broadcast by Fox — commercials and all. — Lillian Rizzo",

No other TV event beckons such a large audience in one sitting. Last year more than 123 million people tuned into the Super Bowl. This year it’ll be broadcast on Fox, as well as aired on its free streamer, Tubi, which could mean more viewers, too.“The scale and buzz factor still delivers a punch,” said Amy Leifer, DirecTV’s chief advertising sales officer.For brands there are some factors that play into whether spending big on the Super Bowl is worth it. One important factor is the ad’s placement during the game, getting as specific as what quarter the ad airs in. And thinking of the target audience rather than the size of the audience is important, too, said Andre Banks, CEO and founder of ad data firm NewWorld.Launching a new product is always a positive during the Super Bowl, said Kevin Krim, CEO of EDO, an ad data firm.

That’s about half the national average for the overall CPI.However, previous bouts of inflation mean that chicken prices are much higher than they were just four years ago. The price for chicken parts today is up almost 25% from 2021. By contrast, the general CPI is only 21% higher than it was four years ago.— Gabriel CortésKendrick Lamar headlines halftime showKevin Mazur | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesKendrick Lamar accepts the Song of the Year award for “Not Like Us” onstage during the 67th Annual Grammy Awards at Crypto.com Arena on Feb. 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.Rapper Kendrick Lamar is headlining this year’s halftime show fresh off a massive night at the Grammys.Lamar’s “Not Like Us” single swept all five categories it was nominated in last weekend, winning Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song and Best Music Video.The song made waves when it was first released in May as one of several diss tracks traded between Lamar and fellow rapper Drake.

Broadcaster Fox sold out of ad spots in the fall for the Super Bowl, and more than 10 of its 30-second commercials were priced at $8 million, CNBC previously reported. Advertisers that got in early spent more than $7 million, the person said.Few live events or TV programming garner the audience that the Super Bowl does each year, ensuring advertisers are willing to pay up to have their brands in front of millions of eyeballs at once.Last year Nielsen reported roughly 123.7 million people watched the Super Bowl. This year has potential for even more viewers with Fox offering the game on its free streaming service Tubi.— Lillian RizzoFree streamer Tubi will air the Super Bowl for the first timePavlo Gonchar | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe Super Bowl is no stranger to streaming as broadcasters have been offering simulcasts of the game on their services in recent years. What’s different this year is that the Super Bowl will be available on Tubi, the Fox-owned free, ad-supported streaming service.Consumers without cable TV subscriptions or access to the game through traditional methods will be able to watch it for free on the Tubi app, which is available on streaming TVs, devices and phones. Fox Deportes’ Spanish-language telecast will be offered, too, and Tubi will have an exclusive pregame Red Carpet show for those looking for an alternative to the typical pregame show.Tubi’s viewership skews toward millennials, Gen Z and women, expanding potential fandom for the NFL and reach for advertisers that have shelled out big bucks. Tubi will air the same feeds as those broadcast by Fox — commercials and all. — Lillian Rizzo",

        "description": "DURING a recent visit to Cebu, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. commended political leaders of Central Visayas for making the region the fastest-growing region in the Philippines in 2023 (PIA, Feb. 5, 2025). The region's gross domestic product grew by 7.3 percent, compared to the 5.5 percent growth logged at the national level. The four provinces — Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental and Siquijor — and the three highly urbanized cities of Cebu, Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue all recorded growth rates above the national. The growth rates of the HUCs outpaced those of the provinces. Among the four provinces, Cebu province posted the lowest growth at 6 percent (2018 prices).Cebu is the fifth most populous province in the country (2020 census). Its gross domestic product was in 2023 the sixth largest among the country's 82 provinces and the only province outside of Luzon in the top 10.Proximity to the capital city or metropolis is obviously a factor in economic development. We see the same in Cebu. Data from 2021 indicates that poverty incidence rises the farther away from Metro Cebu one gets. The good news is that the province has made tremendous strides in bringing down poverty since the double whammy of the pandemic — which shut down tourism on which Cebu depends much — and Typhoon Odette (Dec. 16, 2021). While Cebu province had the lowest per capita income in Central Visayas as of 2023, the Philippine Statistics Authority reported a significant decline in poverty incidence from 36.5 percent in 2021 to 21.9 percent in 2023.Agriculture, forestry and fishing accounted for 8.9 percent of Cebu's gross domestic product in 2023 (2018 prices). According to PSA's 2022 Census of Agriculture and Fisheries, around 520,000 persons (15 percent of the population) are engaged in agriculture in Cebu. Some 30,639 households, on the other hand, have at least one person engaged in fisheries. This is approximately 3.8 percent of all households, or some 125,000 individuals, who depend on fisheries as a major or minor source of income.This modest number reflects the reality that Cebu's fisheries sector has shrunk considerably in the past 20 years. The volume of total production — commercial fisheries, municipal fisheries, and aquaculture — was 25,987 metric tons (MT) in 2023, a huge drop from 2022's 44,890 MT (PSA, Oct. 30, 2024). Aquaculture and municipal fisheries suffered declines above 50 percent, while the commercial fisheries sector, coming from an all-time low, experienced a modest recovery.While seeing a slight increase from 2023 to 2024, marine capture fisheries — commercial and municipal — production was only at two-thirds of its 2022 level. But that is only a tiny part of the picture. According to data collated by Karagatan Patrol (I couldn't find historical data from government sources), the volume of Cebu's capture fisheries production went from 75,000 MT in 2005 to 23,000 MT in 2024. Commercial fisheries dominated 20 years ago, with annual catch reaching 50,000 MT in 2005. The volume declined until 2022, when it reached 6,000 MT. Marine municipal fisheries, on the other hand, peaked in 2020 and 2021 at 50,000 MT and 48,000 MT, respectively, but then dropped sharply to an estimated 15,000 MT in 2024. Overall, Cebu's marine capture fisheries today produce only a third of the volume it produced in 2005.Cebu was once famous for its rattan furniture. Massive deforestation, however, spelled the end of the furniture industry as we knew it, depleting domestically available raw materials. The necessity of managing our natural resources in a sustainable manner should have been the lesson learned from that experience. Sure enough, an annual three-month closed fishing season has been implemented in the Visayan Sea since 2013. The Tañon Strait is a protected seascape. Relevant laws and regulations have been enforced. These measures notwithstanding, Cebu's capture fisheries production continues to decline. The BFAR Central Visayas blamed the \"illicit use of commercial fishing methods\" and the use of fine mesh nets for the meager 2023 production (The Daily Tribune, Nov. 22, 2023). Is this type of lawlessness alone to blame for the emptying of fishing grounds? Has the destruction of the marine environment rendered the fishing grounds unproductive? Do we have large-scale unreported fishing?Cebu's case of diminishing fisheries production is, on a national scale, neither the only one nor the most extreme. Iloilo's fisheries, for example, have fared even worse. Fishing grounds in the Philippines and worldwide are under severe stress due to a multitude of factors, including pollution, climate change, overfishing, reclamation activities and destructive fishing methods. The Mercidar ruling, by declaring the jurisdiction of LGUs over municipal waters unconstitutional, has introduced even more uncertainty into the management of marine resources in the Philippines, including Cebu. But that doesn't change the fact that it is in everybody's interest to ensure that there will still be fish to catch for us tomorrow and for the generations to come.",

        "description": "AMMAN — Statistical data from the Jordan Logistics Association (JLA) revealed a significant increase of 85.9 per cent in the number of inbound containers arriving in the Kingdom through the Aqaba Container Terminal (ACT) in January, compared to January 2024.According to figures obtained by the Jordan News Agency, Petra, the number of inbound containers at the ACTrose to 41,519 in January, up from 22,332 during the same month in 2024.The number of containers from the Kingdom also saw a 19.4 per cent increase, reaching 8,204 containers, compared to 6,872 in the corresponding period last year, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported.President of the JLA Nabil Khatib, attributed this rise in inbound and outbound container traffic to stability in the Red Sea region, which has facilitated the smooth arrival of container ships.Khatib also pointed to the increase in containers heading for Syria and Palestine via the Aqaba port, expecting this to continue and even reach higher figures in the coming months.Khatib, who also serves as the first vice president of the Amman Chamber of Commerce, stressed the importance of recognising this growth and enhancing manpower, handles equipment, and incentives for transit goods passing through the Kingdom.He underscored the need for all relevant authorities to provide necessary facilitations to make Aqaba port more attractive and dynamic, allowing it to regain its former role in handling transit cargo of various types.Khatib underscored that restoring Aqaba port to its previous levels of activity would positively impact Jordan’s economic status, particularly benefiting the transportation sector, which serves as a key driver for various commercial, service, and industrial sectors.The JLA was established in 2007 to represent employees in the freight industry, foster a competitive environment, protect shipping agents, and improve industry regulations for freight forwarders and logistics service providers.

        "description": "TEHRAN — Authorities in Iran ordered schools and offices in at least 10 provinces to close on Sunday to conserve energy amid a severe cold snap and heavy snowfall, state media reported.Freezing temperatures have gripped the northern half of the country over the past few days, causing a spike in energy consumption.\"All government offices and schools are closed on Sunday, and remote learning has been arranged for students,\" the state news agency IRNA announced.Among the provinces affected are Lorestan in the west, Semnan in the east and Gilan in the north.Some parts of Gilan, around 130 kilometres north of Tehran, saw snow fall to a depth of 220 centimetres, meteorologist Mohammad Dadras told the Fars news agency.The shutdown decision followed a similar measure on Saturday, when authorities ordered closures in more than 20 of the country's 31 provinces because of the extreme weather.The capital also saw closures on Saturday but those affected reopened on Sunday -- a working day -- despite the wintry conditions.IRNA said on Sunday some areas of Tehran received up to 30 centimetres of snow overnight.The snowfall caused widespread traffic disruption, and some residents cleared snow as others enjoyed snowball fights in city parks.Snow is not unusual for Tehran in February, but the combination of heavy snow and sudden temperature drops caught many people off guard.Heavy snow and rain across most of the country on Sunday also led to road closures.IRNA reported travel disruptions in 25 provinces, with the heaviest impacts in the north and west where authorities advised people to stay at home for the next 24 hours.Temperatures in at least 19 provinces fell to zero degrees Celsius or lower on Sunday, IRNA said.Iran often orders educational institutions and offices to close during winter, citing extreme weather and fuel shortages.Image: Section: RegionDisplay Lead for: SectionAgency: AFPImage Position: Right",

        "description": "A study conducted by US researchers has brought forth some more worrying information about microplastics — people who died in 2024 were found to have higher levels of microplastic and nanoplastic (MNP) concentrations in the brain and liver, than those in 2016. This suggests that, as the years pass, human exposure to these health hazards is growing. The study, titled ‘Bioaccumulation of microplastics in decedent human brains’, was conducted by researchers from the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of New Mexico Health Sciences, New Mexico, and published in Nature Medicine earlier this week. The researchers extended the timeframe of their study by analysing samples as far back as 1997, and found the same outcome: growing concentration of MNPs in the human body as the years pass.“The present data suggest a trend of increasing MNP concentrations in the brain and liver. The majority of MNPs found in tissues consist of PE (polyethylene, a commonly used plastics) and appear to be nanoplastic shards or flakes,” the writers noted in the study. “MNP concentrations in normal decedent brain samples were 7-30 times greater than the concentrations seen in livers or kidneys, and brain samples from dementia cases exhibited even greater MNP presence,” they added, but noted that the data are “associative and do not establish a causal role for such particles affecting health”.Specifically with regard to the dementia findings, the researchers noted that “atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood–brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase MNP concentrations; thus, no causality is assumed from these findings”.The researchers have called for deeper study into the subject “to understand whether MNPs have a role in neurological disorders or other human health effects”.“Given the exponentially rising environmental presence of MNPs, these data compel a much larger effort to understand whether MNPs have a role in neurological disorders or other human health effects,” say the study authors.ALSO READ | Is Air Pollution Making India Age Faster?Plastic Age: A Destructive TruthWe live in the Plastic Age, surrounded by plastic in our food, homes, food packaging, cloth fibres, and environment. While plastics made our lives incredibly easier (can’t do without toothbrushes, car parts, shoes, storage containers, and computers) — there is no denying that it is also harming the planet. Yet, a solution to this growing problem that mankind created evades the species.What Are Microplastics And Nanoplastics (MNPs)?MNPs are incredibly tiny bits of plastic that break off or shed from larger products. Microplastics: Particles that are 5 millimetres or smaller. They include the remnants of plastic as it degrades, and products such as some exfoliants added to facewashes and scrubs.Nanoplastics: Particles that are 1 millimetre or smaller and are created from the breakdown of larger plastics in the environment. Microplastics pervade the soil, air, and water. Microplastics have been found in the blood, saliva, liver, kidneys, placenta and even breastmilk of humans, while nanoplastics have been found in the upper airways of humans and in most food and water.These tiny monsters have made their way into many of the tissues of our bodies, including our brain, reproductive organs (both male and female), and cardiovascular system, said Dr Leonardo Trasande, the director of environmental paediatrics and the vice-chair for paediatric research at NYU School of Medicine as he spoke to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta on his podcast ‘Chasing Life’.“It’s much more pervasive than meets the eye... We eat a lot of plastic. We inhale a lot of plastic” in the form of dust, Trasande said. “We literally use cosmetics that reabsorb in our body… We’ve just come to accept plastic as normal. And it’s not normal,” Dr Trasande said.Dr Trasande has spent the last two decades studying how environmental exposures, including to microplastics, affect our health. Here’s what he told CNN about how to realistically reduce our exposure and the future of combating microplastics.ALSO READ | Fitness Expert Calls For Swiggy, Zomato To Eliminate Plastic Containers; Here's Deepinder Goyal's ResponseChemicals That Leak from PlasticsPlastics contain harmful chemicals like phthalates, bisphenols, and PFAS, which can disrupt hormones and affect growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Some are added to make plastic flexible or durable, while others sneak in as impurities.While plastic-makers claim safety, and the US Food and Drug Administration says current levels don’t seem harmful, concerns remain. Want to reduce exposure? Trasande shared five tips. Avoid Canned Foods Earlier, a chemical named bisphenol A (BPA) was commonly used in the lining of many metal food and drink cans, lids and caps. Though BPA has mostly been removed from food-can linings, it’s still used in about 5% of cases, possibly more. Its common replacement, bisphenol S, may be just as harmful, and has leached into the environment as well. Some cans now use plant-based resins like oleoresin, but their safety is unclear. If given a choice, opt for oleoresin-lined cans — but the best option is to avoid cans altogether and choose glass, stainless steel, or fresh foods instead. Keep Plastic Away From Heat and Harsh Cleaners Heat and strong cleaners can break down plastic, making it unsafe. Beware of misnomers and misleading promises such as “microwave-safe” or “dishwasher-safe” plastics. There is no truth to these claims and they only mean that when subject to the specific form of heat, the plastic won’t warp — not that it won’t release chemicals. During the use period, plastic sheds tiny particles and chemicals, especially when heated, which can seep into your food. Scratched or cracked plastic, like worn-out cutting boards or lids, should be thrown out, as they increase the risk of chemical leaching. Avoid Plastics Marked 3, 6, and 7 Check the recycling number on plastic containers. These numbers will help you to find out what kind of plastic you’re dealing with.→ ‘3 (PVC)’ may contain phthalates, linked to health risks like cancer, heart disease, and reproductive issues.→ ‘6 (Polystyrene)’ can release styrene, a possible carcinogen.—> ‘7 (Other)’ is unpredictable, making it risky.For single-use plastic bottles, recycle them after one use — they’re not made for repeated wear and may leach chemicals or grow bacteria if not washed properly. Choose Safe Cookware Opt for stainless steel or cast iron instead of non-stick cookware, which is often coated with Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene, also known as PTFE). When heated, non-stick coatings can release harmful chemicals like PFOA, linked to cancer, hormone issues, and developmental problems. Scratched or damaged pans increase the risk of these chemicals leaching into food. Non-stick coatings contain PFAS, also known as ‘forever chemicals’, which can contaminate water supplies. As Trasande put it, “What you think isn’t plastic may actually be plastic.” Hidden Source Of Microplastics: Household Dust Regularly vacuum with a HEPA filter, and use a wet mop to reduce dust, which carries tiny plastic particles. These microplastics come from clothing, furniture, carpets, and protective coatings like water repellents and flame retardants. Since plastic is everywhere, dust collects it from various sources. Air filters can also help by trapping microplastics while reducing bacteria and viruses like those that cause colds and flu.The writer is a senior independent journalist.",

        "description": "Researchers have made an incredible discovery in the Canadian Arctic: the remains of an ancient glacier that could be more than a million years old.Found preserved in permafrost on Bylot Island in Nunavut, Canada, the glacier was an accidental discovery. Daniel Fortier, a geomorphologist at the University of Montreal, had been studying a fossilized forest on the island with colleagues in 2009.Melting permafrost caused landslides in the area, revealing a translucent layer of ice just above the fossilized forest. Fortier told Science News that he was surprised when carbon dating showed that the organic matter trapped in the glacier was over 60,000 years old. A research paper co-authored by Fortier and published this year on GeoScienceWorld suggests that the ice is over 770,000 years old.“As such, this represents the oldest glacier ice preserved in Arctic permafrost landscapes and the earliest evidence of a Pleistocene glaciation in the eastern Canadian Arctic,” reads the paper.However, research on the fossilized forest beneath suggests that the glacier could be even older. The forest is estimated to be around 2.8 to 2.5 million years old, which could also be the glacier’s maximum age.The discovery of the remnants of this glacier is significant as it’s essentially a frozen time capsule. The glacier could contain trapped particulates and gas bubbles, offering a glimpse of Earth’s ancient history. It could also give researchers insight into the climate of over a million years ago.According to Fortier, their findings are also important because, although studies suggest that permafrost will thaw in several regions by the end of the century, their discovery highlights its resiliency.“I don’t think permafrost will disappear so fast. The system is more resilient than we think,” he said.",

        "description": "SOME of the foremost authorities on environmental issues converged in Islamabad this past week to talk about the urgent nature of the climate crisis in Pakistan. Alongside these experts at DawnMedia’s Breathe Pakistan conference, policymakers and jurists, too, laid out both the scale of the challenge and the action required to surmount it.Pakistan faces what Supreme Court Justice Mansoor Ali Shah calls a “dual injustice” — bearing a disproportionate burden of climate impacts while lacking the structural capacity to respond. The conference’s outcomes were sobering. Pakistan needs $40-50bn annually until 2050 for climate adaptation, yet current flows amount to barely one-eighth of that. {try{this.style.height=this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+'px';}catch{}}, 100)\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:250px;position:relative\" src=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/card/1890111\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms\"> The World Bank’s climate chief, Valerie Hickey, highlighted that while 70pc of global climate finance goes to mitigation, Pakistan’s pressing need is adaptation. More concerning still, less than 20pc of total climate finance reaches the Global South, where it is needed most.Some bright spots emerged. Punjab has allocated Rs100bn for climate resilience and Rs10bn specifically for smog mitigation. KP’s forests serve as a carbon sink, removing half of Pakistan’s carbon emissions. The centre’s Uraan Pakistan initiative promises to integrate climate resilience into energy and development planning. But these efforts, while laudable, are dwarfed by the scale of the challenge. The outcome of inaction is already visible. We lost 97 school days to climate disruptions in 2023-24.The Indus, Pakistan’s lifeline, is now the world’s second-most plastic-polluted river. Air pollution alone causes 128,000 deaths annually, reducing life expectancy by 3.9 years and costing the economy billions. By 2050, nearly half of Pakistan’s agricultural land could become unsuitable for farming.The conference crystallised three imperatives. First, climate finance must be restructured. The finance minister’s call for more predictable, flexible, and grant-based support reflects the frustration with current mechanisms. Second, regional cooperation is essential. Pakistan’s initiative to engage with India on transboundary air pollution is a promising start. Third, domestic resource mobilisation must improve; we cannot wait for foreign help while our glaciers melt and crops fail. {try{this.style.height=this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+'px';}catch{}}, 100)\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:250px;position:relative\" src=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/card/1890112\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms\"> The path is clear, if daunting. We must streamline our climate governance, implement the Climate Change Act’s delayed provisions, and create promised institutions like the climate change authority. The private sector must be better incentivised to help find climate solutions.The media also has a vital role. By shifting from disaster reporting to solutions-oriented journalism, it can engage the public and hold policymakers accountable. It must also break down the jargon that often hinders effective climate communication. The conference has shown the way. The question is whether the country can summon the political will — both local and international — and resources to follow it.Published in Dawn, February 9th, 2025",

Reports have emerged that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have engaged in discussions focused on ending the ongoing war in Ukraine. This represents the first known conversation between a U.S. president and Putin since early 2022, marking a potential step toward addressing the conflict.In a recent interview from Air Force One, Trump remained tight-lipped about the frequency of his conversations with Putin, emphasizing discretion. However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov neither confirmed nor denied the interactions, indicating ongoing communications on multiple fronts.As speculation grows about a potential summit, U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz has highlighted efforts to use diplomatic leverage, including sanctions, to bring about negotiations. Meanwhile, the involvement of U.S. officials in European discussions mirrors renewed international interest in Ukraine's rare earth resources amid evolving diplomatic dynamics.",

        "description": "THE catastrophic floods of 2022, which submerged a third of Pakistan and caused $30 billion in economic losses, laid bare the harsh reality of climate change in emerging markets.The disaster displaced 33 million people, wiped out 10pc of GDP, and devastated millions of acres of farmland, triggering soaring food insecurity and inflation. Pakistan’s already fragile economy was pushed to the brink as its farms flooded, its infrastructure crumbled and the public sector struggled to respond to crisis calls from every direction.Admittedly, this was the country’s biggest climate catastrophe, and it required massive relief and rehabilitation efforts from a cash-strapped government that did not have the resources to respond. And, yet, this was not a crisis created by those who were suffering its consequences. {try{this.style.height=this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+'px';}catch{}}, 100)\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:250px;position:relative\" src=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/card/1874162\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms\"> Even though Pakistan accounts for less than one per cent of global emissions, it has already sustained climate-related damages of billions of dollars and is expected to lose over 6pc of its GDP annually due to climate-related damages, like floods, heatwaves and reduced agricultural productivity. As United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres bluntly put it: “Pakistan is a double victim — of climate chaos and of an outdated, unjust global financial system that blocks middle-income countries from accessing the resources they need for adaptation and resilience.”Pakistan requires an estimated $40-50 billion annually for meeting its climate adaptation and mitigation needs. Yet, despite being one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, it only receives $1.5-2 billion annually from international climate funds, multilateral development banks, and bilateral sources combined. Key sources include the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the World Bank’s climate investment funds.In the case of GCF, which remains the largest climate fund in the world, Pakistan has only secured $250 million to date, contrasting sharply with India’s $782 million and Bangladesh’s $441 million, highlighting a significant mismatch that threatens to undermine its resilience against future shocks.While the much-discussed Loss and Damage Fund offered a glimmer of hope for vulnerable nations, the complex mechanics of accessing climate finance — from project preparation to implementation — remain a significant hurdle for frontier markets, like Pakistan.Trillions of dollars in climate finance are theoretically available, with multilateral banks, sovereign funds, and private investors pledging record amounts towards mitigation and adaptation. The global green finance market crossed $1.5 trillion in 2023, and institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, along with various other climate funds, have ramped up commitments. Yet, for emerging markets like Pakistan, accessing these funds remains a struggle.Pakistan requires an estimated $40-50 billion annually for meeting its climate adaptation and mitigation needs. But it currently receives only $1.5-2 billion from international climate funds. In the words of UN chief, Pakistan is a victim as much of climate chaos as of an unjust global financial system that blocks middle-income countries from accessing the resources they need for adaptation and resilience.Complex approval and accreditation processes, stringent credit ratings, and high borrowing costs often mean that even climate-focused capital flows disproportionately to lower-risk, higher-return projects in more developed economies compared to going where it is most needed.Meanwhile, billions in pledged funds sit unused, stalled by operational inefficiencies and a lack of viable financial instruments tailored to the needs of climate-vulnerable nations. Without structural reforms to unlock these funds, climate finance risks becoming more about commitments than impact. {try{this.style.height=this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+'px';}catch{}}, 100)\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:250px;position:relative\" src=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/card/1878227\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms\"> As the world continues to suffer from the consequences of climate change, there is increasing acknowledgement, echoed at the last half-a-dozen UNFCCC annual climate meetings, that more needs to be done to support vulnerable countries, like Pakistan. Practitioners are aware that systems take time to shift, but as various stakeholders wait to see what the most recent change in US climate policy can predict for climate finance, it is also abundantly clear that we just do not have the time.Even today, Pakistan continues to grapple with record temperatures against a backdrop of rolling economic crises, and urgent questions remain about how to respond to these threats when traditional funding markets invariably remain out of reach.The data paint a stark picture. Since June 2023, each consecutive month has broken global temperature records dating back to 1850, with the past decade (2014-24) marking the warmest period in recorded history. During this period, Pakistan has also consistently ranked among the world’s ten most climate-vulnerable nations with devastating consequences on the ground. Temperatures in major cities regularly surpass 45°C, with unpredictable rainfall, droughts, landslides, and devastating extreme weather events severely impacting agricultural yields and water tables.The economic implications of Pakistan’s climate vulnerability are particularly acute in its agricultural sector, which underpins both food security, employment and export earnings. Contributing 24pc to GDP, the sector provides critical inputs to manufacturing and textile, that in turn account for 75pc of export revenues. {try{this.style.height=this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+'px';}catch{}}, 100)\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:250px;position:relative\" src=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/card/1881511\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms\"> Further, almost half the labour force is employed in agriculture and a vast majority of rural households entirely depend on it for their livelihoods. As such, the impact of climate on agriculture is well worth discussing in some detail, as climate shocks to the sector send shockwaves through the entire economy, compounding existing fragilities and deepening instability. And what makes things much worse is that the system is already stretched extremely thin.As context, Pakistan’s agricultural sector is not only fragmented, but also deeply inefficient. Farming remains largely reliant on outdated techniques, exposing producers to unpredictable weather, disease outbreaks, and price volatility. These structural weaknesses have left Pakistan’s agricultural productivity trailing global standards — output per hectare for key commodities, such as wheat, cotton and rice, is 30-50pc lower than the world average.For smallholder farmers, who cultivate 90pc of farms and half the country’s arable land, productivity is even more constrained, lagging by an additional 30pc. It is no surprise then that even though Pakistan ranks as the world’s eighth-largest wheat producer, its yield of 2.9 tonnes per hectare stands in sharp contrast to that of Ireland, which is the 60th largest producer, having a yield 72% higher.The structural inefficiencies plaguing the agricultural sector create a vicious cycle of vulnerability for its farmers. The fragmented value chain compounds these challenges. Multiple intermediaries — from commission agents to wholesalers — extract margins at each step, driving up consumer prices while depressing farmer income. Accordingly, Pakistani rice farmers capture just 35pc of retail prices, compared to 65pc for their counterparts in India and Bangladesh.In short, deep-rooted market distortions, limited access to weather advisory services, and outdated farming techniques have eroded productivity. Low yields, high post-harvest losses, and razor-thin margins create a self-reinforcing ‘poverty trap’, where farmers lack the capital to invest in modern farming and climate adaptation, leaving them ever more exposed to weather shocks. Decades of underinvestment in capacity-building and systemic resilience have only compounded this fragility — turning agriculture into a sector entirely unprepared for escalating climate threats. {try{this.style.height=this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+'px';}catch{}}, 100)\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:250px;position:relative\" src=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/card/1890458\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms\"> This not only affects farmer income, but cuts across to increasing food insecurity in a context where 90 million people are already food-insecure and 38pc of children under five years of age are stunted. Also affected are areas like water shortage, rural-to-urban migration, current account imbalances, and the socio-economic fabric.Clearly, Pakistan and other climate-vulnerable agrarian economies need to urgently invest in climate adaptation solutions to build resilience at a macro level. Given the limitations of available funding, it is also abundantly clear that there needs to be a real focus on project development. Private-sector investments in climate-focused agribusinesses present a commercially viable opportunity to address adaptation challenges, and do not require navigating potentially complex public-sector processes to get started. However, securing funding that aligns with the long-term nature of climate projects is essential.Given the scale of the problem, Pakistan needs to develop a multi-stakeholder approach with private and public sector engagement. Accordingly, keeping the agriculture sector in mind, but extending to a broader focus on financial solutions, a few recommendations seem appropriate:Bankable Projects: Efforts should be made to come up with projects that may attract investment, and leverage climate finance efficiently. Even if unlimited funding were to become available (and it is not going to be the case), we need to develop high-quality, commercially viable projects with robust IRRs and realistic risk/return profiles. {try{this.style.height=this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+'px';}catch{}}, 100)\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:250px;position:relative\" src=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/card/1883345\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms\"> Financial Innovation: Utilise blended finance models and other innovative financial mechanisms to de-risk investments, attract private capital to higher-risk but impactful projects, and expand access to finance for smallholder farmers and early-stage innovators. Instruments such as sovereign green bonds can be used to offer alternative ways to mobilize funds while aligning incentives with sustainability goals. At the same time, parametric insurance and catastrophe bonds could provide financial buffers against climate disasters, reducing the strain on public finances.Fintech-driven solutions, including digital lending for smallholder farmers and carbon credit markets, can further expand access to climate finance. However, for these innovations to succeed, Pakistan must develop a stronger regulatory framework, deepen capital markets, and enhance institutional capacity to scale investable climate projects.Impact-Focused Grant: Acting as a catalyst for further private sector engagement and unlocking the potential for transformative solutions. This includes results-based financing, including carbon credits and impact bonds, concessional loans with forgiveness clauses, quasi-equity with no/low expected returns, and debt swaps for climate goals.The Right Investment: Pakistan has struggled to develop stable, high-quality institutions and mechanisms that are specifically dedicated to climate finance, which makes it difficult to effectively access, manage and implement climate funds. The lack of institutional capacity and technical expertise results in limitations on project development, and a low base of high-quality, bankable climate project proposals that meet international standards and funding requirements. {try{this.style.height=this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+'px';}catch{}}, 100)\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:250px;position:relative\" src=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/card/1890528\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms\"> Better coordination is needed between various government departments, as well as between federal and provincial levels, to present a unified approach to climate finance. Lack of clarity on key priorities and stakeholders can further delay funding decisions. In addition, frequent changes in government and policy directions can also create further uncertainty for international donors and investors, potentially limiting long-term commitments.Developing and attracting specialized knowledge in climate finance, technology, and policy is crucial. We can learn from other developing countries, like Bangladesh and Chile, that are highly vulnerable to climate change have developed regulatory roadmaps and mechanisms for building capacity for national climate resilient development.At this point, Pakistan urgently needs to foster a vibrant climate ecosystem by connecting early-stage innovators with established players, facilitating knowledge sharing, engaging experienced climate investors with corporates and experts to provide technical support and enable technology transfer to local climate solutions. The focus should be on collaboration, and mentorship to drive innovation and scale impactful solutions.Additionally, offering technical assistance to help public institutions integrate climate risk considerations into development planning and policymaking can enhance the ability of government agencies to develop robust, climate-resilient projects that meet international funding standards for grant-based loans and concessional financing.Private-Sector Engagement: With fiscal constraints and rising debt levels, Pakistan cannot afford to rely solely on public funds to finance its climate response. Private sector engagement is critical to mobilising large-scale investment in climate resilience and low-carbon development.Creating an enabling regulatory environment — through targeted incentives such as tax breaks for green investments and mandatory climate risk disclosures — would help attract capital to climate-related projects. Blended finance models and public-private partnerships can further de-risk investments, ensuring both financial returns and equitable climate action. Beyond funding, private sector participation brings technological innovation, efficiency, and expertise, fostering solutions that are both economically viable and sustainable. {try{this.style.height=this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+'px';}catch{}}, 100)\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:250px;position:relative\" src=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/card/1890596\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms\"> A paradigm shift is needed — one that prioritizes financial innovation, institutional reform, and private-sector engagement. Pakistan must urgently build a pipeline of bankable, climate-resilient projects that can attract both concessional and commercial capital, particularly in the agriculture sector.At the same time, global financial institutions also need to reform their frameworks to ensure that climate-vulnerable nations can access financing on equitable terms. Without real reform, the gap between climate pledges and disbursements will keep increasing, turning climate finance into little more than empty promises at annual COP gatherings.Pakistan’s ability to navigate this crisis will entirely depend on bold policy reform, strategic long-term investment in climate adaptation, and a multi-stakeholder approach that brings together the public and private sector. Indeed, the scale of the challenge is immense — but the cost of doing nothing is far worse.The writer is the Regional Managing Director, Acumen.",
